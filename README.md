## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js + npm installed on your machine

### Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MhdSinanC/Meme-Generator-React-.git
cd Meme-Generator-React-
````

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the development server (via Vite). Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port Vite shows in your terminal).

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates an optimized production build in the `dist/` folder. Then you can serve it by any static‑file server or deploy it (e.g. to Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).
